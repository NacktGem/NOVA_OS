# Black Rose Collective Terms of Service

## 1. Overview
Black Rose Collective ("BRC") is a private, encrypted platform for adult creators and patrons. Access is restricted to consenting adults over 18. By using BRC you agree to these terms and any policies referenced herein.

## 2. Privacy and Security
BRC stores minimal data and encrypts all personally identifiable information. We do not employ third‑party trackers. Device fingerprints and access logs are hashed. Suspicious activity triggers automated anti‑leak routines and watermarking.

## 3. Content and DMCA
Creators retain full copyright over uploaded media. BRC will act on valid DMCA notices submitted to `copyright@blackrose.cx`. Repeat infringement results in account termination. Users may not upload or distribute content they do not own or have rights to share.

## 4. Age Verification and Consent
All creators must complete government‑issued ID verification before publishing. Consumers must self‑attest their age and may be asked to re‑verify. Content featuring multiple parties requires documented consent from every participant.

## 5. Payments
Transactions are processed through end‑to‑end encrypted channels. Chargebacks and fraud are investigated by the Audita agent. BRC may suspend accounts for payment disputes or unresolved balances.

## 6. Platform Rules
- No harassment, doxxing, or distribution of non‑consensual imagery.
- Auto‑generated scraping or data mining is forbidden.
- Users are responsible for securing their credentials; compromised accounts may be locked by Riven.

## 7. Admin and GodMode
Nova, the sovereign agent, exercises GodMode for system integrity. GodMode actions are logged and reviewed by Audita. Admin access may grant or revoke user capabilities, perform takedowns, or quarantine content.

## 8. Termination
BRC reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these terms or any applicable law. Users may request deletion of their data at any time.

## 9. Changes
We may update these terms. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
