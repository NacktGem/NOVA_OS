# Black Rose Collective Law Enforcement Policy

BRC honors legitimate legal process while prioritizing user privacy. We maintain no real‑time surveillance and store only hashed access logs.

## Emergency Requests
Urgent life‑threat matters may be sent from official domains to `blackrose@protonmail.com`. We respond once identity and jurisdiction are verified.

## Legal Process
- All requests must include a court order or warrant that specifies the account and data sought.
- Data is produced in encrypted form and only for the time range mandated.
- Requests outside our jurisdiction are rejected.

## Transparency
Audita records every disclosure and publishes aggregated statistics quarterly. Users are notified unless legally prohibited.

## Minimal Disclosure
We disclose only data explicitly ordered by the court. If no data exists, we confirm non‑existence.
