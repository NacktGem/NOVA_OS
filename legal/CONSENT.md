# Black Rose Collective Consent Policy

## Collaboration and Release
Creators must obtain written consent from all participants before uploading collaborative content. Releases are stored encrypted and are reviewable by Audita upon dispute.

## Identity Verification
Every creator undergoes ID verification to prevent impersonation. All uploads are tagged with creator ID and cryptographic watermark to deter leaks.

## Dispute Resolution
Claims of unauthorized appearance can be filed at `consent@blackrose.cx`. Content is quarantined while Nova and Audita investigate.

## Audit Trail
All consent forms and moderation actions are hashed and preserved for legal audit. BRC cooperates with lawful orders while defending user rights.
