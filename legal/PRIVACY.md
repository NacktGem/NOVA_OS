# Black Rose Collective Privacy Policy

## Data Minimization
We collect only the data needed to operate the platform: login credential hashes, payment tokens, and encrypted contact email. Usage analytics are processed locally and discarded.

## Zero Trust and Encryption
All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Internal services authenticate through signed tokens; cross‑service requests are denied by default.

## User Control
Users may export or delete their data through account settings. Deleted data is purged from active systems within 30 days and scrubbed from backups within 90 days.

## GDPR and CPRA
Residents of applicable jurisdictions may exercise their rights to access, rectification, deletion, and objection by contacting `privacy@blackrose.cx`.

## No Third‑Party Tracking
BRC does not embed external analytics scripts, pixels, or fingerprinting services. Payment providers receive only the minimum metadata required to process transactions.
