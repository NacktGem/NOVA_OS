# Platform Directive

Black Rose Collective delivers a sovereign, encrypted social platform for adult creators. Every component ships productionâ€‘ready: no placeholders, no test data, and no unauthenticated services.

## Build Principles
- Agents operate locally first and communicate through signed messages.
- All modules must be auditable and reproducible from source.
- Deployment targets are containerized with minimal images.

## Compliance
Legal documentation, consent trails, and audit logs are mandatory. The Audita agent governs external requests while preserving user rights.
