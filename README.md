# NovaOS-Core-Systems

NovaOS is a sovereign, agent-based operating system designed for fully local execution. The system powers the Black Rose Collective platform and the Family Dashboard, providing a secure environment with modular AI agents.

This repository contains the core layout for NovaOS and related services. Each agent lives in its own folder under `NovaOS-Core-Systems/agents/`, and shared utilities live under `/tools`, `/configs`, and `/scripts`.
